#Todo App with Vanilla JS

### About This Project
LINK: https://todo-app-js-beige.vercel.app/

This Todo App is a personal project created for learning and practice. It's simple and quick for my own practice sessions. 

It is built using vanilla JavaScript, without any frameworks or third-party libraries. The goal is to strengthen my core JavaScript skills such OOP by working directly with the pure language. I'm planning to return to this project and update it to include more functionalities, componenets, more pages, auth and cover more topics in the longer run.

Key JavaScript topics practiced:
OOP,  

Working with objects,   

DOM manipulation,  

Event handling,  

Local storage

Modular code  

and more!

I'm still updating and will be adding more features/functionality.
