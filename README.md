This Todo App is a personal project created for learning and practice. It's simple and quick for my own practice sessions. 

It is built using vanilla JavaScript, without any frameworks or third-party libraries. The goal is to strengthen my core JavaScript skills by working directly with the language. I'm planning to return to this project and update it to include more functionalities, componenets, more pages, auth and cover more topics in the longer run.

Key JavaScript topics practiced:
Working with objects

DOM manipulation

Event handling

Local storage

Functions and modular code
